this project is a monorepo for the [web-based bracket][1] and the discord bot
used to update it (coming soonâ„¢)

## todo

- [ ] style the website and make it look nice
  - [ ] dark theme too!
  - [ ] make the website look good on mobile too
- [ ] make a discord bot that updates [`data/structure.json`][4] w/ commands
- [ ] move all the files around for a dedicated gh pages branch
  - [ ] custom gh action for deployment? idk probably
    - [ ] also auto-minify `data/structure.json` on build if we do that
